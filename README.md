### House Price Prediction | ML Project from Scratch to Deployment

Built with precision, purpose, and passion â€” this project is not just another machine learning demo. Itâ€™s a complete, production-grade pipeline for predicting house prices, meticulously developed by me to showcase my end-to-end expertise in data science and real-world deployment. Whether you're a recruiter, a fellow ML enthusiast, or someone scouting for a capable ML engineer â€” this project is my proof of concept.

From raw data wrangling to sleek deployment via Flask/Streamlit, this repository goes beyond tutorials. Itâ€™s engineered, documented, and structured like something you'd find powering internal dashboards or product prototypes.

##  ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

âœ… Real-world ML workflow (Data â†’ EDA â†’ Modeling â†’ Evaluation â†’ Deployment)âœ… Advanced regression techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression)âœ… Clean, modular, object-oriented Python codebase written entirely by meâœ… End-to-end Jupyter notebook & script support for transparency and reproducibilityâœ… Deployment-ready with Flask or Streamlit for live demonstration

## Objective : 

To build a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices based on historical data. This project was designed to not only apply core machine learning concepts but to simulate an actual production-level workflow that companies would expect from a machine learning engineer.

## Tech Stack : 

Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

ML Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Deployment: Flask (API) or Streamlit (UI)

## Features & Capabilities:

 Advanced EDA: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations

Feature Engineering: Encoding, scaling, interaction terms

 Model Optimization: GridSearchCV, evaluation metrics, feature importance

 Deployment Ready: Live API or GUI to make real-time predictions

## Customization Tips :

Replace the dataset with another real estate dataset

Swap out models for deep learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)

Integrate MLflow for experiment tracking

Deploy on Heroku, AWS, or Render for public access

## Future Improvements
